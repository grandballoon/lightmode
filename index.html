    <h2>Coding Coaching for Artists</h2>

    <p>
        <em>Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.</em>
        <br/>
         -Edsger Dijkstra
    </p>

    <p>
        We often talk about code as if it were fast fashion: a world of trends and waste where everything is constantly changing. 
    </p> 

    <p>
        But code is really more like <em>sculpture</em>. Rather than "making more stuff," engineering is about chipping 
        away towards the elegant expression of an <em>idea.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You don't need a math degree or a coding bootcamp to do this. 
        You just need the right perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
        For artists, this is not a new idea. Books like the amazing <em>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</em> 
        have shared simple, effective ways of learning to draw for decades.
    </p>

    <p>That works for coding, too. Let's take an example: </p>

    <p>
        <em>Reducers</em> are a powerful coding pattern. A reducer takes a list of things, modifies them,
        and spits them out again. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Writing a complex reducer is a reasonably advanced programming skill; they're a core part of many modern apps, including Facebook and Uber.

    </p>

    <p>
        So it's easier to use this pattern's musical name, <em>autotune</em>:
    </p>

    <p>
        from functools import reduce as autotune

        # Stuff inside [] brackets works like a tape reel — you can loop forward and back, repeat things, etc.
        lyrics = [
            "I'm up in the woods",
            "I'm down on my mind",
            "I'm building a still",
            "To slow down the time"
        ]
        
        bon_iver_voices = [
            trademark_falsetto,
            soulful_wailing,
            intimate_baritone,
            secretive_croon
        ]

        def looping_process(vocal_track, bon_iver_voice):
            return vocal_track + [bon_iver_voice(line) for line in lyrics]

        woods = autotune(looping_process, bon_iver_voices, []) 
    
    </p>    

    <p>
        The mark of a great engineer is not "smartness"; it's the ability to recognize and work creatively with patterns. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, if you watch an experienced
        engineer work, you'll notice how they speak, squint, 
        and even <em>move their body</em> like a painter trying to "find" the contour of a subject's profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        What we usually think of as "coding"—typing words into a text editor—is a secondary skill. Seeing the pattern comes first.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is what Lightmode offers: coaching to see the code behind the code, using the skills you already have as an artist.
    </p>


    
    <p><em>There are only two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.</em>
    <br/>
    -Edsger Dijkstra (again)
