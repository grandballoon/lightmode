    <h2>Coding Coaching for Artists</h2>

    <p>
        We often talk about code as if it were fast fashion: a world of trends and waste where everything is constantly changing. 
    </p> 

    <p>
        But code is really more like <em>sculpture</em>. Rather than "making more stuff," engineering is about chipping 
        away towards the elegant expression of an <em>idea.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You don't need a math degree or a coding bootcamp to do this. 
        You just need the right perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
        For artists, this is not a new idea. Books like Betty Edwards' wonderful <em>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</em> 
        have shared simple, effective ways of learning to draw for decades.
    </p>

    <p>That works for coding, too. Let's take an example: </p>

    <p>
        <em>Reducers</em> are a powerful coding pattern. A reducer takes a list of things, modifies them, and spits them back out again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Writing a complex reducer is an advanced programming skill; they're a core part of many large apps, including Facebook and Uber.

    </p>
    <p>
        But a musician will recognize this pattern as imitative counterpoint (or maybe "autotune"). Here's Bon Iver's <em>Woods</em>, written here in valid Python:
    </p>

    <p>
        The mark of a good engineer is not "smartness"; it's the ability to recognize and work creatively with patterns. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you watch an experienced
        programmer work, you'll notice how they speak, squint, 
        and even <em>move their body</em> like a painter trying to "find" the contour of a subject's profile.
    </p>
    <p>
        What we usually think of as "coding"—typing words into a text editor—is a secondary skill. Seeing the pattern comes first.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is what Lightmode offers: coaching to see the code behind the code, using the skills you already have as an artist.
    </p>

        We're rolling out several pilots over the course of Summer 2025. If you're interested, fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScq41-fn_FsSWXji8HsdmtRjNTA3wO7DKDJeNqPzun2DcCEVA/viewform">this form</a>, and we'll get back to you soon.
