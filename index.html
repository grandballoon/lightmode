        ## Programming, too, becomes a way of seeing. You can also do this with the AI tools you already use, if you use them.
        ## Plus, it's fun.

    <h2>Coding Coaching for Artists</h2>

    <p><em>Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.</em></p>
    <p>-Edsger Dijkstra</p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        We often talk about code as if it were fast fashion: a world of trends and waste where everything is constantly changing. 
    </p> 
    
    
    <p>
        But like the arts, the industry is different from the craft. The <em>act</em> of coding is much more like sculpture. Rather than adding things on top (like more money, or advanced degrees) the joy of coding comes from chipping away, bit by bit, towards the elegant expression of an idea.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Even if you know nothing about code, you don't need a math degree or intensive study to do this. You just need a slightly different perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
        Artists understand this principle intuitively. Books like Betty Edwards’ <em>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</em> have taught elegant methods of looking at the world through art for decades. Very similar skills apply to the learning of code.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        Coding, too, is more about seeing than it is about thinking (or "talent"). For example, <em>Reducers</em> are a powerful programming concept: they take a list of individual items, modify them somehow, and combine them into a single, new collection. Writing a complex reducer is considered an advanced programming skill, and a lot of modern websites would break without them.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is easier to understand if you just call it "imitative counterpoint" (or "autotune"):
    </p>
    
    <p>
        from functools import reduce as autotune

        # Stuff inside [] brackets works like a tape reel — you can loop forward and back, repeat things, etc.
        lyrics = [
            "I'm up in the woods",
            "I'm down on my mind",
            "I'm building a still",
            "To slow down the time"
        ]
        
        bon_iver_voices = [
            trademark_falsetto,
            soulful_wailing,
            intimate_baritone,
            secretive_croon
        ]

        # Repeat each refrain with many filters on one track:
        def looping_process(vocal_track, bon_iver_voice):
            return vocal_track + [bon_iver_voice(line) for line in lyrics]

        woods = autotune(looping_process, bon_iver_voices, []) 
    
        </p>
    
    <p>
        Taking the normal artistic process—investigating and transforming life through making—and using code, instead of paint or music, is equally simple: recognize the patterns you already know from art; then implement them. Learning syntax is the easy part.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Like having good relative pitch, the mark of a seasoned engineer is the ability to see these patterns. In fact, when a good professional looks at a piece of code that doesn’t work as expected, you will notice them physically squint as they “see” the pattern behind the syntax of the programming language; they look like they’re doing a contour drawing.
    </p>

    <p><em>There are only two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.</em></p>
    <p>-Edsger Dijkstra (again)</p>
    
    <p>
        This is what Lightmode offers: coaching to see the code behind the code, using the skills you already have as an artist.
