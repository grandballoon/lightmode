        ## Programming, too, becomes a way of seeing. You can also do this with the AI tools you already use, if you use them.
        ## Plus, it's fun.

    <h2>Coding Coaching for Artists</h2>

    <p><em>Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.</em></p>
    <p>-Edsger Dijkstra</p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        We often talk about code as if it were fast fashion: a world of trends and waste where everything is constantly changing. 
    </p> 
    
    
    <p>
        But like the arts, the industry is different from the craft. The <em>act</em> of coding is much more like sculpture. 
        Rather than adding things on top (like more money, or advanced degrees) the joy of coding comes from chipping 
        away, bit by bit, towards the elegant expression of an idea.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Nobody needs a math background or years of study to do this. 
        We need a way to enhance our perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
        Artists understand this principle intuitively. Books like Betty Edwards’ <em>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</em> 
        and David Hockney's <em>Secret Knowledge</em>have taught elegant methods of rapidly learning art skills through
        our natural perception for decades. The computer graphics engineer Tim Jenison even reproduced a Vermeer this way, with no artistic training.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Coding, too, is more about seeing than it is about thinking (or "talent"). 
        For example, <em>"Reducers"</em> are a powerful web development concept: they take a list of individual items, modify them somehow,
        and combine them into a single, new collection. 
        Writing a complex reducer is a reasonably advanced programming skill; they're a foundational part of many modern codebases, like Facebook and Uber.
    </p>

    <p>
        But in music, we call the same pattern <em>"Imitative Counterpoint"</em> (or "autotune"):
    </p>
    
    <p>
        from functools import reduce as autotune

        # Stuff inside [] brackets works like a tape reel — you can loop forward and back, repeat things, etc.
        lyrics = [
            "I'm up in the woods",
            "I'm down on my mind",
            "I'm building a still",
            "To slow down the time"
        ]
        
        bon_iver_voices = [
            trademark_falsetto,
            soulful_wailing,
            intimate_baritone,
            secretive_croon
        ]

        def looping_process(vocal_track, bon_iver_voice):
            return vocal_track + [bon_iver_voice(line) for line in lyrics]

        woods = autotune(looping_process, bon_iver_voices, []) 
    
        </p>
    
    <p>
        This is a question first and foremost of <em>how we look at things.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The mark of a great engineer is not "smartness"; it's the ability to recognize and work creatively with patterns. (In fact, if you sit next to an experienced
        coder while they debug a broken program, you'll notice how much they look, talk, and even move like a painter trying to find the correct contour of a subject's chin.) 
        
        What we usually think of as "coding"—typing words into a text editor—is a secondary skill, and mostly a question of correctly implementing syntax. That's the difference
        between charcoal and conte crayon, not scribbles and masterworks.
    </p>

        <p>
        This is what Lightmode offers: coaching to see the code behind the code, using the skills you already have as an artist.
    </p>
    
    <p><em>There are only two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.</em></p>
    <p>-Edsger Dijkstra (again)</p>
