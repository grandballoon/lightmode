        Dev Dinners are a chance to effectively learn programming, from the level of a complete beginner, in a relaxed dinner party environment.

    Dev Dinners are part of the Summer of Pilots.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Lightmode is running Dev Dinners throughout Summer 2026. The next one is Friday, June 20th, at 7pm (at a <span>&#127881;</span>"secret location"<span>&#127881;</span>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the course of these dinners, we’ll go through the history, theory, and practice of programming through a wide variety of lenses designed to make coding intuitively accessible even (and especially) to people who were told they were “bad at math.”
