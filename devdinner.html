        Dev Dinners are a chance to effectively learn programming, from the level of a complete beginner, in a relaxed dinner party environment.        
    </p>
    <p>
         Dev Dinners are one of Lightmode's <a href="/pilots">Pilots</a> for Summer of 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first dinner is Friday, June 20th, at 7pm in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn (ticket link below). These will run throughout Summer 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the course of these dinners, we’ll go through the history, theory, and practice of programming through a wide variety of lenses designed to make coding intuitively accessible even (and especially) to people who were told they were “bad at math.”
    </p>
